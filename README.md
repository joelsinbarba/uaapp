# Uaapp
App developed to learn about Flutter. Chose to make an app for my university since they do not provide an iOS application for students.

## Demo

Developed January-February 2018
Most of the API calls were "hacked" from an earlier API version, so most features no longer work.
You will also need student credentials to log in.
