# Uaapp
App developed to learn about Flutter. Chose to make an app for my university (Universidad Autonoma de Asuncion) since they do not provide an iOS application for students.

## Demo
<img src="/readme/demo.gif" width="200"/>

Developed January-February 2018.

Most of the API calls were "hacked" from an earlier API version, so most features no longer work.
You will also need student credentials to log in.

### Features

- Polished UI
- Authentication
- Get student's information
- Get today's events (e.g. You a math class today at 19:00)
- Get student's subjects by semester
- Get student's scores by subject
- Read news
- Basic error handling
