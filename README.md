# Uaapp
App developed to learn about Flutter. Chose to make an app for my university (Universidad Autonoma de Asuncion) since they do not provide an iOS application for students.

## Demo

Developed January-February 2018.

This is basically an application that allows you to quickly check your status on all your classes.

Most of the API calls were "hacked" from an earlier API version, so most features no longer work.
You will also need student credentials to log in.

### Features

- Polished UI
- Authentication
- Get student's information
- Get student's class schedules
- Get student's subjects by semester
- Get student's scores by subject
- Read news
- Basic error handling
